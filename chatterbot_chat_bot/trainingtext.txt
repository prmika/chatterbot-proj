i feel sorry for anyone who loses their home.	so do i, but not if they're rich.
same as ever, by mail. all it costs me is a 42-cent stamp.	i meant, are you going to vote for or against the new taxes?
see you later.	bye.
check your tires or you'll get a flat.	oh. that's not good.
yes, but i was stuck there all day while they looked for the bomb.	someday the bomb is going to be for real.
our team won 101-98.	sounds like it was a close game.
why?	because you don't want to smell bad.
i wash them, and then steam them for 15 minutes.	that's pretty simple.
i don't know.	would you like to see a movie with me and my friend?
but you know that california weather is really unpredictable.	you're right. one minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.
in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.	let's turn on the heat.
i don't want to see a movie by myself.	okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?
i have no idea. all of a sudden i heard your siren.	you rolled through that stop sign back there.
i think i know the difference between picking and scratching.	okay, mom, maybe i was picking it a little bit.
i am really excited for you.	are you really?
you're right. i think it's going to rain later.	in the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.
i really want to go to the movies this weekend.	so go then.
i'm not sure.	how about a pizza?
i've been missing you like crazy.	i don't understand why you haven't come to visit me.
i'm doing great. what about you?	i'm absolutely lovely, thank you.
which one?	"deal or no deal"
can i pick you up friday night?	what time?
why is there so much crime?	because parents don't teach their kids right from wrong.
what did they say?	they said i need a new hard drive.
i'll make sure and come to your next party.	i'll look for you at my next party.
why did she do that?	he said he would buy her a nice ring.
but cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.	well, you can't have everything.
they shouldn't even call it news.	last night they told us about a cat in a sofa.
pasta is processed food. potatoes are natural food.	natural food has more vitamins.
that's the truth.	and you get to play with a lot of dogs.
what's wrong with it?	it aches most of the time.
that's what everyone says.	you're trying to tell me something.
i went to macy's and picked it out.	i love your outfit right now.
they're behind the outfield.	maybe we can catch a home run ball.
you would do the same for me.	of course. what are friends for?
what does she look like, though?	she has pretty light brown eyes.
what are you going to do?	first, i have to find the button.
did you hear about the ball player?	the home run hitter on drugs?
think about something else. think about a hamburger.	i'm thinking, but i still have to go.
a couple of months ago.	you still miss him.
thank you very much, that's kind of you.	don't mention it.
i have to feed them.	are you looking for another job?
are you interested?	maybe. what is she like?
it's not my fault. you didn't wake me up.	that's not my fault. you didn't tell me to wake you up.
it was nothing for him.	he sank a 20-foot putt on the last hole to win by one stroke!
so do i.	i love to eat the peanuts.
it's six years old.	that's pretty old.
i checked all my pockets.	did you look in your desk?
it shouldn't take him long to fix it.	i don't even know why we need to fix it.
no, ten of my coworkers got laid off, too.	what are you going to do?
i eat the same thing every day.	you're kidding.
she asked you about your pineapples?	i told her i had gotten the last two on the shelf, but i offered her one of mine.
do you want me to wake you in an hour?	no, thanks. just let me sleep until i wake up.
really? how many do you have?	i don't know, maybe one hundred.
you should be happy, not worried.	i am happy, but marriage is a lot of responsibility.
i have to walk the dog.	what kind of dog do you have?
maybe they'll give us free drinks for waiting so long.	maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.
or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.	let's find a house that's at the end of a dead end.
it must've been a close game.	it really was. you should've gone.
but it's uncomfortable.	it's the law.
let's go to a movie.	i'd rather not.
my family and i are going to dinner.	i was hoping you would come.
i can't stand cigarette smoke.	it smells so bad.
a gardening show follows a knitting show.	a cooking show follows a sewing show.
you can travel all over the world.	i know. i went to china yesterday.
i think some fish have blue eyes.	i hope i don't come back as a fish.
about 50 percent of the time he's traveling.	where does he travel to?
teaching is the best part of my whole day.	you're a lucky man to have a job you love.
do you have any other skills?	well, i know how to flip hamburgers.
will you lose all your files?	no, i always back up my files.
i bet dad did it all the time when he was my age.	your daddy was a good little boy.
i would if i could find someone who makes strong pockets.	try a google search online.
congratulations on your promotion.	thank you very much.
what's on tv?	nothing much.
what time does it start?	the party starts at 8.
you don't have any elbow room or knee room.	people are always getting up to use the bathroom.
yes, and it takes about five minutes each time.	i'll try.
no, they don't. one is black and one is dark blue.	yikes! thank you.
i'll bet this is the first time you've ever flown during christmas.	you're right.
people think you might be sick.	who thinks that?
all the news in only 50 pages.	i like the political cartoons.
seriously, it looks really nice on you. where did you buy it from?	i bought it from the macy's at the santa anita mall.
i think that's an excellent reason to like something.	thanks, i feel the same way.
when does it start?	at 8:00 p.m.
of course not. that would be racist.	but how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?
no, florida just has hurricanes every year from june to october.	but most of those hurricanes are harmless.
so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.	that means we have to leave the house at 9:15.
do you need a calculator?	no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.
i started shopping at the dollar store.	that saves a lot of money.
we'll be at mcdonald's in just a few minutes.	i hope they are fast minutes.
that's a lot of money.	but the house is so nice.
but a house is so expensive.	that's why we need to save money.
i don't know.	it's better to be pale than to have skin cancer.
i agree.	you never know what might happen on these freeways.
last year we made a big snowman.	how big was it?
well, i got a lot of good deals, as usual.	like what?
are there more fish or more people?	i think there are more fish.
is it your birthday or anniversary?	no, it's earth day.
what's that?	it's a yearly reminder to take care of our planet.
perfect. we don't have to listen to barking dogs.	and there are only six units in the whole building.
so are mine.	why did your parents get divorced?
put on a coat and tie.	why?
i'm going to be a teacher.	high school or middle school?
no problem. so how have you been?	i've been great. what about you?
do you really love me?	of course.
especially for drivers of big trucks.	the wind blows those trucks over.
he's never going to make everyone happy.	can you imagine being president?
i've just been working really hard.	i've also been busy.
i don't want to go alone.	so, will you be at school tomorrow?
that's disgusting.	and he poured water into our glasses.
i love salads.	me too.
that's your favorite thing to do?	well, it's one of them.
you'd better buy your ticket now.	you must be kidding.
and the government will give you a fourth story.	yes, like the government says not to worry about the swine flu.
is that right?	it's the truth. i am really happy.
how do you like it so far?	i like it so far. my classes are pretty good right now.
i'm still feeling under the weather.	would you like anything for your stomach?
what are you getting for your mom?	what are you talking about?
doing what?	i'm going to dinner with my family.
no. the teacher doesn't permit calculators.	how about a dictionary?
people are friendly.	yes, they are.
what does it say?	the mayor says the crime rate is going down.
that must have made you feel really special.	oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us.
can we go to the baseball game?	of course.
yes. he said he'd be here at 9 o'clock.	did he understand what the problem is?
why not?	because you'll have an accident. most accidents are because people are in a hurry.
i believe so.	good. i hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.
what do you want to do next time?	would you like to go to dinner or something?
what did the doctor say?	he thinks i have too much stress.
she's cute.	okay, so she's not ugly; she's just fat.
what do you mean?	i mean, it's just coffee.
but it was full of pencils! how could he say it was empty?	artists see things differently.
i'd better see you there.	of course.
but the title of measure 1 is "better schools at no cost."	the title should be "better schools at huge cost."
man, that was a really close game.	that's what made it so great.
did he get rich from his poetry?	probably not.
i really like those. how much did they cost?	they were about forty dollars.
i got a ticket yesterday.	what for?
no, a real breakfast.	bacon and eggs?
and carry it into the house.	all we have to do is flip a switch.
i don't believe anything i don't see with my own eyes.	you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.
she's got a great personality.	uh-oh. that means that she's fat and ugly.
well, mostly i'll try to avoid it.	i mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?
that sounds like fun.	do you think you can come?
yeah, i went to school today. were you there?	no, i didn't go, i've been sick.
but most of those hurricanes are harmless.	excuse me. hurricane andrew destroyed 30,000 homes!
i don't know. i just woke up.	why don't you look outside?
did you check all your pockets?	i checked all my pockets.
i don't want to go to hell.	let's go to church with your parents on sunday.
there are other things i need to take care of.	what is it that you need to do? 
i don't think so.	is there a reason why?
then you can wipe your seat and window.	people will think i'm strange.
what happened before?	my hard drive crashed.
nope, and it drives him crazy.	he knows you can't read his mind. maybe he thinks you're cheating.
why not?	you know i don't like crowds.
me neither. it's boring.	but practice makes perfect.
they don't believe us?	no. they can only give a ticket if they see it happen.
bring me a better steak.	i wouldn't do that.
let's go jogging.	that's a good idea.
no, i haven't.	she's really pretty.
i think so. it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun.	it really does, i can't wait.
someone cut the tires.	what tires?
it's no problem. i was really missing you anyway.	i missed you too.
this looks like a nice table.	no, it's too close to the salad bar.
then you should watch the rerun.	why? i'm watching the original.
our kids are completely safe.	so why are we selling our house?
have you tried earplugs?	they don't work, either.
that's the way cats are.	all they think about is themselves.
oh, no, you don't.	what do you mean?
i think he closed the bowling alley in the white house.	oh, yeah. he's changing it to a basketball court.
not a lot. what about you?	i'm throwing a party on friday.
what would you like to see?	oh, i don't care. you're the one who wants to go out.
it's a great price. but you have to dial a lot of numbers.	how many?
that's what i thought.	what did she say?
but the same thing day after day gets old.	well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different.
i really wasn't told anything.	she was a cute 8 pounds 6 ounces.
that's no good.	sometimes the pain goes away, and sometimes it doesn't.
a team of doctors gave her a whole new face.	why did they do that?
i may know which girl you're talking about.	so you have seen her around?
that sounds like a great job.	whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me.
number five, it's unsafe.	you're right. bad guys might rob you.
but he's supposed to be making our city a better place.	he's visiting other cities to get ideas.
the streets and sidewalks are clean.	yes, they are.
maybe you're right.	maybe we should get going.
okay. i just put a stamp on the envelope.	give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you.
maybe you should, just in case it gets colder.	i'll put a glove in each pocket.
i like this restaurant because they give you free bread.	well, i think we are paying for it.
i switched from pasta to potatoes.	why did you do that?
look in the fridge.	i'm looking. there's nothing to eat.
yes, i did.	and?
well, if you bring your receipt, maybe they'll give you $400.	i'll keep my receipt and my gun.
okay, until next time then.	i'll call you so we can set that up.
when you're inside, you will always hear cars stopping and stopping at the intersection.	or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.
what was your problem?	my stomach was bothering me.
that was a great trip to washington, d.c.	tell me about it, dad.
that's for sure.	no one knows what happens after we die.
so?	so, forget it.
you eat too much chocolate.	i don't think so.
what do you do?	i'm a babysitter.
it hurt her feelings.	oh.
clean the sink, the tub, the counter, and the toilet.	that's a lot of work.
i'm going to clean it.	don't use water on it!
no, it's earth day.	what's that?
what do you mean?	you would float into the sky like a balloon.
oh, no. we can walk right in.	let's go now. i'm hungry!
then i have a job for you in my kitchen.	it will cost you only $20 plus parts.
i'm a babysitter.	is that a lot of work?
i don't feel like going.	why not?
it sure is.	in fact, it's chilly in the apartment, too.
i drove around for half an hour.	did you find a spot?
it really does, i can't wait.	what time does the party start?
what are you going to do about your death?	well, mostly i'll try to avoid it.
i can't spend four hours on the road every day.	by the time you get home, you'll be too tired to even eat.
where does he travel to?	oh, all over the world.
stop thinking about what the point is.	okay. i'll start thinking about having some fun.
i warned her about her new boyfriend. she didn't listen to me.	what happened?
you shouldn't lie in the sun for too long.	i want to get a tan. i don't want to look so pale.
why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.	the speed limit is 65!
that sounds delicious.	i know a good chinese restaurant.
don't ever be in a hurry when you're driving.	why not?
what difference does it make?	female singers are supposed to be pretty.
i'll be glad when winter comes.	why is that?
that's too bad.	my mother was hurt and angry.
the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know.	that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
he probably won't use drugs anymore.	but it won't stop other players from using drugs.
i made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.	i couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.
yes, it's very dirty.	you can help me.
i will be glad to do the same for you when you're sick.	well, thank you. i hope to see you at school tomorrow.
what are you going to be doing?	my family and i are going to dinner.
but you eat fruits.	i eat two apples, one banana, and one orange every day.
i can smell you.	i can smell you, too.
will you be able to make it?	i'm busy this friday. i'm sorry.
i think it's the ice cream.	you started eating ice cream?
men singers don't have to look good.	then neither do women singers.
i will play the radio as loud as i want.	that's okay with me.
what do you mean?	i mean, keep your belongings close to you.
i want you to clean the bathroom.	oh, that's easy.
did you ever take an iq test?	no, i never did. all i know is that i got a's and b's in school.
i went to the beach every day.	how was the weather?
then why were you looking at her?	i was looking at something else.
sometimes i wish i was back in school.	me, too. school was fun.
i agree.	this city is full of jerks.
i think we'll be there in half an hour.	i hope so. i have to go to the bathroom.
why don't you go to bed?	i want to watch this tv show.
check out the silverware.	it passes inspection.
wait till it dries. it will be easier to vacuum.	next time i will be more careful.
people who live in california are crazy.	why is that?
that's not right!	when i started to cross the street, the white walk sign was blinking.
that's a great price.	i think i'll buy both of them.
so are cigarettes.	which would you prefer?
well, i guess that's why he did it.	what's the point?
thanks. i think you look nice today, too.	thank you. i just bought these new shoes earlier today.
you don't need to worry about that.	that was mean to say.
they are so weak.	a little cigarette controls them.
maybe she's different.	they're all the same.
the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.	will it be good beach weather?
i need a job.	what was your last job?
i've been good. i'm in school right now.	what school do you go to?
the mayor won by only 2,000 votes.	we're stuck with him for four more years.
this sunday?	of course. it's all over the news.
how did you get it?	i don't know. maybe it was from a shopping cart.
no, i haven't.	i got a promotion at my job.
you can't see the end of it.	it goes on and on forever.
it gets worse every year.	why are you complaining? we're going almost 20 miles an hour.
that's nice.	are you going to be there?
i use a calling card.	where do you get that?
during the christmas holidays.	you'd better buy your ticket now.
and there are only six units in the whole building.	where's the checkbook? i'm ready to rent it without even seeing it.
did you look in your desk?	yes. it isn't there, either.
they sure are.	did you hear about the pilot?
i think that would be nice.	is there anything you would like to do next time?
why do you like it?	because it has great teachers.
where do you get these crazy ideas?	i used to cook in a restaurant!
do you want anything to make you feel better?	no, thanks. i already took some medicine.
i want to be a baseball player when i grow up.	me too. i want to play for the yankees.
doing what?	working.
why did you do that?	i mixed them together.
no human can do that.	somebody should check his birth record.
i'm having fun.	you're sitting there with your mouth open.
there's something wrong with my right hand.	what's wrong with it?
because i watch the other players.	what do you mean?
so is everyone else.	but a cop might stop you.
we have to practice every day.	i don't like practice.
so how do you think positive?	i think about nice things.
what was wrong with you?	my stomach was upset.
that sounds like fun. what's the weather going to be like?	i heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.
because he likes to scuba dive.	what's wrong with that?
your neighbors will hate you.	if they don't like it, they can move.
i like the ones i can sing along with.	so do i, like "she loves you."
it's in the fridge, i think.	oh, yes, here it is. do you want a sandwich?
just hold on.	oh! don't hit any more bumps!
how long was the flight?	it only took about two hours.
yes. when we landed, tv reporters and the army band were there.	that must have made you feel really special.
i like to see actors who are like real people.	like real people with real problems.
different thingsÂ—not the same thing all the time.	you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?
what kind?	i like to listen to rock and r&b.
some of it is okay, i guess.	yes, the poems that rhyme and are easy to remember.
it's only 10 minutes from here.	do we need reservations?
well, the waiter looked clean, so i guess it's okay to eat here.	you're forgetting about the bathroom.
that's a good question.	did you take it to a computer shop?
that sounds nice.	i want to show you my new car.
are you feeling any better?	i'm still feeling a little sick.
i don't like it.	what's the matter with it?
what's the matter?	i saw you looking at that woman.
we have to find a cheaper house.	of course. we can't live without gas or peanut butter.

yes, i do.	what kind of car do you have?
why do they hurt?	i type too much.
that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.	did you save any money on the sale?
i don't know.	did you call the repairman?
how was the weather?	it was hot and sunny every day.
i've never heard him say please or thank you.	he sounds like a real jerk.
we get a lot of things from cows, don't we?	yes. a cow is man's best friend.
someone had to chop the wood.	and carry it into the house.
i asked because the paper is sitting next to you.	thank you. that's polite of you to ask.
the sky is gray.	is it raining right now?
but big earthquakes happen only once in a while.	once in a while is once too many.
you were, too.	i'm not interested in her.
what were you doing?	i was scratching my nose.
we don't do anything.	maybe we should honk the horn next time.
then go find a tissue in the bathroom.	i didn't have time to get one from there.
of course i do. but not on our flag!	every nation should have a pretty woman on their flag.
i loved it!	did you get free food?
i'm really happy that you came to visit me.	i really missed you a lot.
who did you vote for?	i voted for obama.

shakespeare was a poet.	did he get rich from his poetry?
okay, i'll talk to you later then.	see you later.

it's the best job i've ever had.	what makes it so good?
yes, they don't like troublemakers or complainers.	i can't quit, because i'm making a good salary.

what's the matter with the produce?	do you think the bananas fell from the sky?
did you go to the 99 cents store?	yes, i did.

what do you think it is?	i don't know. i think it's old age.
there's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?	i haven't seen her yet.

then why aren't i having fun?	because you're thinking too much.
i don't have a girlfriend, either.	why not?
the other team lost by three points, 101-98. 	it must've been a close game.
i'll use a damp cloth.	don't let water get into any of the cracks.
i had a busy morning.	what did you do?
i haven't heard anything about it.	can you make it?

we need cheese, bread, and ham.	what kind of cheese?

i took the dog for a walk.	i'll bet he enjoyed his walk.
that was a mistake.	he stayed on the thirteenth floor.
i couldn't go to school today, i was sick.	that's horrible. i'd be happy to give you the assignments from english class.

yeah, i went. did you go?	no, i didn't feel like it.
is that right? i already got my invitation from her earlier.	i believe that she will give me the invitation today.
but you'll be asleep in about one minute.	i'm just yawning because the commercials are on.
why didn't you go to school yesterday?	i stayed home because i wasn't feeling well.

what happened to your car?	i got a dent in the parking lot.
my bad, i had chores to do.	that's all right.
i hope they fit.	i hope you kept the receipt.
what about the unfriendly dogs?	i think if you are friendly to dogs, they are friendly to you.
you need a car with low mileage.	a car that was owned by a little old lady.

nonfat.	of course. what else?
how do you know?	the street isn't wet.
tell me what you've been up to.	i've really been working a lot lately.
i live in pasadena.	where is pasadena?
i wonder if every language has jokes.	of course! people everywhere like good jokes.
when did you get divorced?	i got divorced two years ago.
oh, yeah. the girl died instantly, and the boy is still in the hospital.	the husband said he tried to help the boy.

of course i will.	i just wanted to let you know what happened.
you mean, like a pepperoni pizza instead of a cheese pizza?	no, i mean a salad instead of a pizza.

they work great.	i don't care. i don't like to put drops in my nose.
what height is she?	she's probably about five feet.
you can't believe what you hear on tv or radio.	you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.

i apologize, but i'm getting off the phone now.	okay.
do you go to college?	yes, i do.

the son gave a nice speech about his father.	it was long, too.

a cooking show follows a sewing show.	a travel show follows another travel show.

no, because it hurts my ears.	what do you mean?
i'll get the bait.	we'll have fresh fish for dinner!

like fruit that is too ripe?	yes, just like fruit that is too ripe.
okay. i'll take your word for it.	i thought you had an elephant in your house.
then why are you watching tv?	this is my favorite show.
what good does it do?	you get to put someone in power that you like.
yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.	i know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.
what's wrong?	it's not orange!
okay, let's go see a movie.	until then.
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.	i think i might've bumped into her before.
i went to the market yesterday.	i don't see anything.
i've been thinking about learning spanish.	spanish is easy. i'll be happy to teach you.
look at this traffic.	i'd rather not.
and it's deep, too.	i think it's five miles deep.
how much is it?	i don't know. the tag is missing.
you can't believe what you read in the newspapers.	everyone tells you a different story about the same thing.
they're all so cute.	yes, but i can't keep them.
yes, you chased me and then you caught me.	now you're mine forever.
the sports guy shows us players fighting.	they always tell us "what's next."
i'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.	you're not going to examine it before we order dinner?
a hospital is the most dangerous place in the world.	oh, yes, because of all the killer germs.
i'm throwing a party next saturday.	is that right?
a travel show follows another travel show.	i'll say! i've gone around the world a dozen times already!
i can't wait until i graduate.	me too.
don't be nosey.	i'm not. i just want to know.
i gave her $1,000 for her birthday. i told her to spend it on herself.	that was very nice of you.

that's not a good start.	then he didn't bother to apologize.
but, mom!	you can watch tv after you do your homework.
oh. that's not good.	no, it isn't. a flat costs you time and money.
well, it's good and bad.	what's bad about it?
oh, really?	are you interested?
that's a switch.	i'm serious, have you?
you don't need to have cable, but you do need a good antenna.	but i have rabbit ears.
it will cost you only $20 plus parts.	okay. that sounds like a fair price.
or you'll hear the collision if someone doesn't stop.	or you'll see the collision if they crash into the house.
that's not my fault. you didn't tell me to wake you up.	well, i meant to.
i'll help you.	okay, i'll get a bucket.
did you go to school today?	yeah, i went to school today. were you there?
and ruth was a good person, too.	he always visited hospitals to cheer up sick kids.
she said she didn't love me anymore.	wow! that's terrible.
you need to get a lot of lessons when you're really young.	forget it. golf sounds more like work than fun.

i bought three pounds of potatoes for a dollar.	that's a good deal.
that one. the one that's all black.	yes, i like that one, too.
what do you need to do?	i need to withdraw some money.
if we are good, we will be happy in heaven with god.	that's what many people believe.
that won't make you rich. nobody will talk to you.	i will keep knocking on doors.
and then we can go to my home.	and watch your dvd.
i wouldn't do that.	why not?
well, someone brought it into the house.	look at the bottom of my shoesÂ—they're clean.
maybe he ran out of gas.	look! he just got out of the car and started running.
i would've thought that somebody would have told you.	no, i had no idea.
i had to bring work home with me.	i did too.
did you shine your shoes?	my shoes are shined.
i am dying from the heat.	turn on the air conditioner.
that's a good price.	yes, it's cheaper than a hot dog or a beer.
that's it?	i add some pepper and salt.
a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?	that's a good idea.
you missed a really good game.	oh, really? who won?
oh, it did. there were about 300 people there to honor us.	well, you all deserve it. you helped save our country.
i certainly hope not!	if you got laid off, you'd be flipping hamburgers, too.
we take our rosters to the parking lot and take roll.	why do you do that?
no, i'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because i'm pretty hungry right now.	me, too. let's forget about germs and focus on food.
you don't have the money?	i have no insurance.
but we need to turn left.	forget it. go straight.
then maybe it's in your genes.	you might be right.
i'll be there.	i'd better see you there.
i have to be there two hours early.	so we have to be at the airport at 10:15.
i was doing my homework.	the cat doesn't care about your homework.
yes, it is. but it still looks good.	do you take good care of it?
until then.	talk to you later.
debrah already had her baby.	i didn't know that.
how big is "pretty big"?	it has about 140,000 people.
it's always good to have friends.	friends will lend you money when you're broke.
oh, well, it only cost me a dollar.	only a dollar? don't even look for it.
just lettuce, tomato, and celery.	that's it?
we will be house rich, but cash poor.	what do you mean?
a mad dog bit most of her face off.	oh, that's terrible. what does she look like now?

a movie sounds good.	call me tomorrow then.
whatever the cause, i hate seeing them on my face.	well, on the bright side, they're fun to pop.
i usually eat a simple salad.	what do you put in it?
why not? everyone knows he's a firebug. he loves to start fires.	i don't know. sometimes the law doesn't make sense.
nothing that would pass as news.	what's the weather going to be like this weekend?
it sure is.	i thought school was hard.
our team was victorious.	i wish i was free that night. i'm kind of mad that i didn't go.
well, i guess if it ever does get old, i'll change to something different.	do you eat fruits and vegetables every day?
i don't understand.	if you pour water into a glass, the water goes down into the glass.
let me think about it.	why do you have to think about it?
he said a doctor helped him with a personal problem.	he said he wasn't using drugs.
i want to show you my new car.	you bought a new car?
i hope we'll see a home run.	i hope we'll catch a foul ball.
i think we are!	well, that's okay, as long as it helps him relax and think more clearly.
lately, i've been quite busy.	tell me what you've been up to.
i couldn't find any stamps.	they're in the kitchen drawer.
while you're using the bathroom, i'll order some food.	don't order for me. i'm not hungry.
the speed limit is 65.	i know that.
do you know which one he would like?	oh, yes, i took him there yesterday. he showed me one that he really liked.

cigarettes, of course.	how can he do that?
tomorrow i'm going to buy an electric sharpener.	get one with the rubber suction cups on the bottom.
and i want to get a big cabin with a view.	are you going to travel alone?
thank you. so do you.	i wish my eyes were blue.
i know a good chinese restaurant.	how far away is it?

so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?	it sounds like it will be.
paper can be dangerous.	it hurts, too.
they are bites.	did the cat bite you?
the victim hit his head on the concrete steps and died.	that's terrible. can't people just have fun at a baseball game?
i'm worried.	worried about what?
i will blow my nose sometime for you, and you'll see.	okay. i'll take your word for it.
yes, he was on the tv news today.	every easter sunday he gives away money.
what's the matter?	those books will slip and you'll fall.
it still works, but i'm going to give it to a charity.	are you going to buy a desktop or laptop?
how often do i have to do that?	once every two months.
it's a flying zoo!	i wish i could afford first class seats.
i'm so full i'm going to burst.	you should loosen your belt.
i want to do something tomorrow with you.	sounds good. what did you have in mind?
you'd be blind for the rest of your life!	i'll get the stepladder.
is that what you really think?	yes, i do.
how come?	i like how clear the sky gets after it rains.
have you done your homework?	not yet.
yes, i know. some people are rude.	i always try to be polite.
actors didn't curse back then.	and there was no violence.
that isn't a good deal?	a good gun costs $400 or more.
but i love pizza.	everybody loves pizza.
i pour lots of french dressing on top.	me too. french dressing is so delicious! who cares about calories?
has anyone told you about jessica's party coming up?	i was told about it already. i'm just waiting for my invitation.
no, the banana was delicious.	maybe you just need to go to the bathroom.
thank you. i just got these shoes today.	really? what kind of shoes are they?

i was laughing hysterically the whole time; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.	that's exactly how i felt.
me too.	excuse me. they just called my number.
next saturday, i'm going to have a party.	oh, really?
no. it's in southern california.	is pasadena a big city?
give me the envelope, and i'll mail it for you.	when is grandma going to learn about e-mail?
i could pick only one or the other?	yes. nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.
that's a good idea, because showers waste a lot of water.	from now on i'll spend only 20 minutes in the shower.
you didn't?	nobody has told me anything about your party.
what are you eating now?	i switched from pasta to potatoes.
don't you think it's nice out?	yes, i think so too.
do you think the bananas fell from the sky?	what do you mean?
that's a great idea.	yes, all the markets just started offering wipes to shoppers.
because we need to buy a house.	but a house is so expensive.
i would love to catch a movie this weekend.	so then, why don't you just go?
i'm eating so much bread that i'm getting full.	then stop eating the bread!
a family with only one baby.	that's a good idea.
considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.	exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. it's too hot.

how long have you known how to do that?	i first learned how to do it in high school.
your orange isn't orange?	no, it's dark pink!

i watered all the plants.	you have a lot of plants.
i never thought about that.	you'd be blind for the rest of your life!
i don't think he even got paid for it.	some people do it just to do it.
i'm going to dinner with my family.	i really wanted you to come, but i understand.
let's take a walk.	what's the weather like?
i was taught in high school how to draw and paint.	you had an art class?
this trail is hard to climb.	especially on a hot day like this.
and then what?	and then she'll know that you like her.
i don't park at a store that uses metal shopping carts.	that's a good idea, but there was a good sale at this store.
what was the problem?	someone cut the tires.
i'll have to try them sometime.	they're best when they're hot.
did you see "titanic"?	yes. it is a great movie.

yes. that's why it's also the best hamburger in town.	a great burger and great service.
i was a painter.	what happened?
oh really? she gave me mine earlier today.	well, she'll probably just give me my invitation later on today.
i thought it was next sunday.	well, you'd better get her something.
i like to hit the ball.	i like to run around the bases.
it may have been random, but have you?	i haven't lately.
i do it every once in a while.	how long have you known how to do that?
but in may it will be 44 cents.	have you ever lost a letter in the mail?
i think it's five miles deep.	are there fish at the bottom?
that sounds good.	all right, so i'll see you then.
just ask her out to dinner.	and then what?
maybe he'll send us our waiter immediately.	every time we eat out, it's an adventure.
who's the greatest baseball player?	there are so many great players.
did someone steal it?	i sure hope not.
i didn't hear anything about it.	can you go?
i don't know.	it looks like blood.
i don't have long distance service with my home phone.	so how do you make long distance calls?
did you see that puddle of water on the floor?	yes. i called for a clean-up.
the neighbors don't party on the weekends.	people take care of their lawns.
maybe you should stop shaving.	and grow a beard?
now he has the world record!	but someone's going to break it, so what good is it?
i need to type to make money.	but typing is causing you pain.
then why are some schools telling the kids to stay home?	the government says to wash our hands frequently, and we'll all be okay.

any one. i need to sharpen this pencil.	i think there's one on the dining room table.
was he smoking?	yes, he was smoking a cigarette.
why not?	the seats and windows are dirty.
you have pretty eyes.	thank you. so do you.
what do you mean?	every morning you get up late and rush off to work late.
i type too much.	you should take a break.
i mixed them together.	if the coffee still tastes okay, that's a good idea.
what do you mean?	every time we land or take off, my ears hurt so much.
i was hoping you would come.	i'll definitely try to make it the next time.
the only thing in my backpack is used books.	but thieves don't know that.
i turned up the volume.	that's not what i meant by "do something."
that's unbelievable. can he still breathe?	he can, but the people around him can't.
what's so good about it?	they have interesting lawsuits.
but what can you do?	you can yell at them.
are you really?	i'm serious. you deserved this promotion.
just boil raw peanuts in salt water until the shells are soft.	i'll have to try them sometime.

where did you lose it?	i have no idea.
i'm not in the mood.	what's the matter?

rich people think they're better than us.	how many rich people do you know?
i think there are more fish.	i hope so. i love to eat fish.

i did too.	your day was just like mine.
but a cop might stop you.	no, he won't. some cars are doing 85.
i'll talk to you later.	what's the rush?
you drink too much coffee.	but i love coffee.
oh. of course i'm ready.	did you buy the converter?
are you going to be there?	i don't think so.
who makes up all these jokes?	who knows? but there must be a hundred new ones every day.
i can't believe how long this line is.	this is a popular restaurant, isn't it?
tell me about this patch.	the patch has glue. the hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.
it was new in 2003.	so, it's pretty old now.
it passes inspection.	here comes the waiter. see if his hands and nails are clean.
thank you.	when did he die?
i can smell you, too.	that's my perfume.
he's visiting other cities to get ideas.	can't he just go online?
that would be nice, thank you.	no problem, you're welcome.
no. it costs too much money.	doesn't crime cost more than police?
and then they blow smoke out of their mouth.	they think it's cool.
yes, just in english alone.	i wonder if every language has jokes.
i know. i went to china yesterday.	what did you do?
did you have to blow right next to the phone?	did you hear that?
why is that?	there was a bomb threat at the airport.
i have no idea.	a button is hard to find. did you look in your pant cuffs?
only two cars can make a left turn every three or four minutes.	we'll be here forever.

today is friday the thirteenth.	that's a bad day.
nothing much, what's going on?	i'm having a party this friday.

how rude.	but i got lucky a few minutes later.
how far away is that?	i think we'll be there in half an hour.
i think i'll make a sandwich.	what kind?
look how many cars are waiting in line.	they need a left-turn arrow.
i really wish the weather would just stay the same.	i do too. that way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.
of course. we gave him a big carrot for a nose.	let me help you make one this year.
whatever a customer ordered, i sliced off a little more for me.	did you get fat?
computers are so cool.	i love to go online.
do you get pbs on tv?	yes, everybody gets the public broadcasting system.
did she catch you using drugs?	sort of. she knows whenever i sneak a cigarette.
yes, it does.	so it would be cheaper to hire more police?
i'm not sleeping here tonight.	what's the matter? this is a nice room.
her mom is a great cook.	so, a little salt and pepper never hurt anything.
you mean the measures that will raise our taxes.	but the tv ads say that our taxes will not increase.
you do? i just bought this outfit a couple days ago.	seriously, it looks really nice on you. where did you buy it from?
so, it's pretty old now.	yes, it is. but it still looks good.
no.	how do you know?
you use them to wipe the handle of the shopping cart.	that's a great idea.
i see that you're pretty talented.	thank you very much.
a lot, like the party i'm having on friday.	well, that's cool.
will it be good beach weather?	i think it will be.
but they can just knock on the door.	actually, i want him to look at our carpet, too.
i voted for ralph nader.	who in the world is ralph nader?
let's go to the lake.	yes. the lake is only 10 miles away.
that's harsh.	i'm sorry, but i have to go.
that would be weird.	yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.
please don't be nosey.	i'm not being nosey, it's just a question.
let me help you.	what does "mi" mean?
somebody should check his birth record.	i bet it says he was born on mars.
i believe that she will give me the invitation today.	are you even going to go?
i'm not sure, but i don't think she's given out that many.	well, hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today.
okay. i did something.	what did you do?
no, but that was a random change of subject.	it may have been random, but have you?
so what are you going to do?	i'm joining the army.
i sprinkled salt and pepper on the food before i tasted it.	what's the matter with that?
what do you like about it?	we get a free breakfast.
